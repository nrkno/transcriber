### Authentication in development

You need to enable username/password authentication in Firebase Console. Create an user, and set a password.
Here is how in June 2019:
* Enable Email/Password provider
  * https://console.firebase.google.com/u/3/project/<your firebase project>/authentication/providers
* Add user in Users tab
  * https://console.firebase.google.com/u/3/project/<your firebase project>/authentication/users
* Set password on your newly created user
  * Dropdown menu to the right of the user in Users tab 
  
### Update .env

Add username and password to REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DEV_USERNAME and REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DEV_PASSWORD
